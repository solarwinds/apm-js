# [16.0.0](https://github.com/solarwinds/apm-js/releases/tag/v16.0.0) _(Unreleased)_

## Breaking changes

- Removed support for AppOptics and proprietary native code
  - HTTP proxying is now supported on all platforms and implemented in pure JavaScript.
  - AppOptics customers should stay on the `15.x.x` release line for the time being.
- Migrated to stable HTTP semantic conventions
  - A summary of the changes can be found in the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/non-normative/http-migration/#summary-of-changes).
  - This change may affect transaction names for some applications.
- Reworked runtime metrics to match the semantic conventions
  - Semantic [Node.js](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/runtime/nodejs-metrics/) and [V8](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/runtime/v8js-metrics/) metrics are now collected.
  - Semantic [process](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/system/process-metrics/) metrics are now collected (CPU, memory, context switches, faults).
  - This change may affect custom dashboards and alerts.
  - A new dashboard for Node.js applications powered by these metrics will be available in the future.
- The `fs`, `net` and `dns` instrumentations are now disabled by default as they are very noisy, and must be explicitly enabled if required.
  - See the [configuration options for instrumentations](./CONFIGURATION.md#instrumentations).

## New features and improvements

- Per-span opt-in stacktrace collection
  - This feature can be used via the new `spanStacktraceFilter` configuration option.
- Declarative transaction naming
  - This feature can be used via the new `transactionName` configuration option.
- Stable semantic conventions for database instrumentations
  - The previous unstable attributes are still exported for compatibility, but will be removed in a future release.
- OpenAI instrumentation
- OracleDB instrumentation

# [14.0.0](https://github.com/solarwinds/apm-js/releases/tag/v14.0.0)

## Breaking changes

- This is a completely new version of the instrumentation library built upon OpenTelemetry.
- The library now requires the `@opentelemetry/api` package to be installed alongside it, with the version range `^1.9.0`.
- The public API surface of the library has been greatly reduced. The `@opentelemetry/api` package can instead be used for all custom instrumentation needs.
- The configuration file name has changed and some options have been renamed or altered. Check out [the configuration guide](./CONFIGURATION.md) for more details.
- The list of instrumented libraries has changed as the library now uses OpenTelemetry instrumentation. Custom instrumentations can now also be provided by the user. See [the updated list of bundled instrumentations](../instrumentations/COMPATIBILITY.md) for more details.
- The new library is written in TypeScript and will always provide up to date and accurate type declarations.
- The new library will support all LTS Node.js versions up to one year after their End of Life. Support for older versions will not be provided since they should not be used.

## New features and improvements

- ESM is now supported by default. The recommended way to load the library is now using the `--import` flag instead of the `--require` flag.

## Internal changes

- Upgraded liboboe to `14.1.0`
